# hugo-mock-landing-page
CIS 3500 HW 1 repo 2

My workflow does this: <br/>
Triggers when changes are pushed to main. <br/>
Checks out the repository and any submodules (Hugo themes). <br/>
Installs Hugo with the specified version. <br/>
Builds the Hugo site with draft content, garbage collection, and minification. <br/>
Deploys the built site to the gh-pages branch using GitHub Pages.
